NixOS and home-manager configurations.

== Usage

Before creating any commits, run

  $ direnv allow

which will allow you to use the Git hooks and secrets infrastructure
provided by the flake in `flake.nix`. This will also add some commands
to the environment; consult the list in `devShells.default.

.Updating the flake inputs (i.e., NixOS version used to build system)

  $ nix flake update --commit-lock-file

Make sure to ensure things work and build after doing so and before
committing a lock update, if you can.

.Updating packages somewhat automatically

  $ nix-update <package name> -F --commit

.Updating packages somewhat automatically, but from their Git versions

  $ nix-update <package name> -F --commit --version=branch=master

== Implementation details

=== Secrets (`./secrets`)

We use <https://github.com/ryantm/agenix> for actually managing the secrets.

==== Creating and using a secret

```nix
{
  "my-new-apikey.age".publicKeys = [ alice bob computer ];
}
```

```
~/src/nixos $ nix develop
~/src/nixos $ cd secrets/
~/src/nixos/secrets $ agenix -e my-new-apikey.age
```

```nix
{ self, ...}: {
  age.secrets.my-new-apikey.file = "${self}/secrets/my-new-apikey.age";
}
```
