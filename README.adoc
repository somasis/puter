Here's how I use the computer.

This repository is my NixOS and home-manager configurations,
and xref:bin[scripts].

== Hacking

:url-direnv: https://github.com/cachix/direnv
:url-nixos-cli: https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-cli

Before creating any commits, ensure that you have {url-direnv}[`direnv`]
available and loaded in your shell. Then, run

  $ direnv allow

which will give permission to install the Git hooks and bring tools
sometimes used when working with this repository, into your shell
environment. The devShell is kept in `flake.nix`; consult the package
list in `devShells.default` to see what is included in the development
environment.

== Using

The way I prefer to interface with the NixOS system is through the
`nixos` command, which comes from the {url-nixos-cli}[nixos-cli]
project.

Whenever I get a new machine (a really infrequent occurence!), or
break my computer in some silly way (a slighly more common occurence),
I download the latest NixOS live USB image, and I do something like this

  $ git clone https://github.com/somasis/puter
  $ ponysay 'TODO lol'

.Updating the flake inputs (i.e., the NixOS version used to build
system)

  $ nix flake update --commit-lock-file

Make sure to ensure things work and build after doing so and before
committing a lock update, if you can.

.Updating packages somewhat automatically

  $ nix-update <package name> -F --commit

.Updating packages somewhat automatically, but from their Git versions

  $ nix-update <package name> -F --commit --version=branch=master

== `bin`

Heres a little exposition; I have a few scripts in here that I think
are worth talking about.

=== `beets-import-to-library`

Many of the tools I've written recently have been in service of
making Beets, the command-line music organizer, nicer to use in a
non-terminal environment.

:beets-servicemenu: ./share/kio/servicemenus/beets.desktop

The idea here is to provide a semi-interactive script for importing
albums into the Beets library, allowing the user to break out into
more manual usage of `beet import <album>...` when necessary.

I recently started using KDE Plasma as my main desktop environment
after years of using a `bspwm` based setup, and so I've sought
to integrate it into some typical use cases. Consequentially,
there's a KIO service menu for this tool located at
link:{beets-servicemenu}[`{beets-servicemenu}`]. It provides a nice
menu item, and that's the primary way I interact with it.

Here's a thousand words:

.link:{beets-servicemenu}[The menu item], as shown in Dolphin
image:beets-import-to-library%20%28menu%20item%29.png[A popup
menu created by a right-click action on a directory named "Phish -
Slip Stitch and Pass (1997)", with the menu item "Import to music
library..." highlighted by the mouse cursor.]

.Notification of import starting soon
image:beets-import-to-library%20%28importing%29.png[A desktop
notification as produced by KDE Plasma, titled "Importing..." and
the directory name mentioned previously as the notification message
content. Two buttons are on the notification, one labeled "Import
manually..." and the other labeled "Skip".]

.Notification of successful import
image:beets-import-to-library%20%28imported%29.png[A desktop
notification as produced by KDE Plasma, titled "Music imported to
library" with the message content "Successfully imported Phish - Slip
Stitch and Pass (1997) using metadata from MusicBrainz." Four buttons
are on the notification, labeled respectively from left to right,
"Play", "Open directory", "Undo", and "Reimport manually..." The
notification has an icon on the top right that features the album's
cover art.]

==== `beet-hook-diff-{pluginload,cli_exit}`

These two scripts work to provide a hook for Beets that shows a diff
containing all the changes that happened to its `library.db` during
its run.

They both require that `sqlite3` be present in the `$PATH`. The `diff`
is calculated using the output of `sqlite3`'s `.dump` command.

To use these hooks properly, both need to be declared in Beets' config:

.beets `config.yaml` excerpt
[source,yaml]
----
plugins:
  - hook

hook:
  hooks:
    - event: pluginload
      command: beet-hook-diff-pluginload
    - event: cli_exit
      command: beet-hook-diff-cli_exit
----

.Pitfalls
The `pluginload` hook merely writes the "before"-state of the database,
and the `cli_exit` one writes the "after"-state. Notably, this means that
the diff is liable to be inaccurate and show too many changes if you have
multiple instances of `beet` modifying the database at the same time.
Future plans include fixing this by making the hooks run closer to the
database opens and writes, such as running `pluginload` at `library_opened`
instead. Plus, instead of gathering changes, the `cli_exit` hook could be
ran at `database_change`, and then the change diffs could be written
incrementally, being more accurate to changes done by the invoking
instance of `beet`. If we keep using `.dump` though, that would entail
all the impediments that incurs (slowing down `beet` by dumping already
calculated database values, potentially causing lots of churn).

// keep-sorted end

So here's the idea. Let's say you're a fan of the jam band
link:https://phish.com[Phish]; it could happen to you! In the last year or so
after leaving college, I got really into Phish, and I wanted to write something
that would let me listen to shows on link:https://phish.in[Phish.in] without
using the website. I wrote some initial versions that used `mpv` to play them,
mostly fumbling around with trying to get `mpv` to do gapless playback of the MP3
files being streamed directly from Phish.in. Eventually, it seemed that I would
need to reencode the MP3 files in order to get it to play gaplessly, if I need to
download them just to get gapless playback, then I might as well automate the
process of downloading shows and importing them into in my music library
properly, and simply _play them with my music player_ instead of using `mpv`.
Naturally, it turned into a lot of effort because I was having fun with figuring
out the most ergonomic design for the tools.

Or, let's say you want to download the ten most liked shows that Phish played
during the years 1995 to 2008, and then import those shows into your Beets
library:

....
~ ∴ phish-list-shows -d 1995..2008 -S likes_count -n 10 \
    | xargs beet-import-phish
....

The most complex script is probably `phish-list-shows`, mostly because I had
to account for the Phish.in API's pagination, and pagination feels kinda funny
to deal with using only `curl` and `jq`. But all the tools are pretty simple
and basic and not more than 300 lines.

:example-show: https://phish.net/setlists/phish-may-07-1994-the-bomb-factory-dallas-tx-usa.html

`phish-show-notes` is a nice one, which uses the link:http://phish.net[Phish.net]
API to get display a show's setlist notes. It's modeled after the layout of
Phish.net's own webpages for notes (link:{example-show}[example]).

Tweezer was teased in the Sweet Emotion Jam. Amazing Grace was performed
without microphones. This show was officially released as Live Phish 18.

=== `upload`

A script for uploading files to services like 0x0.st (which it
defaults to).

It was once packaged in nixpkgs, but isn't anymore since the URL to it
in my previous dotfiles repository became invalid. Maybe again someday.

== Implementation details

=== Secrets (`./secrets`)

I use <https://github.com/ryantm/agenix> for actually managing the
secrets. Ideally, `age-plugin-tpm` is what provides the machine and
user identities which the secrets are encrypted, too.

==== Creating and using a secret

```nix
{
  "my-new-apikey.age".publicKeys = [ alice bob computer ];
}
```

```
~/src/puter $ nix develop
~/src/puter $ cd secrets/
~/src/puter/secrets $ agenix -e my-new-apikey.age
```

```nix
{ self, ...}: {
  age.secrets.my-new-apikey.file = "${self}/secrets/my-new-apikey.age";
}
```
