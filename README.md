# puter

Here’s how I use the computer.

This repository is my NixOS and home-manager configurations, and
[scripts](#bin).

## Hacking

[`direnv`]: https://github.com/cachix/direnv

Before creating any commits,
ensure that you have [`direnv`] available and loaded in your shell.
Then, run

    $ direnv allow

which will give permission to install the Git hooks and bring tools
sometimes used when working with this repository, into your shell
environment. See `shell.nix` for details on what’s included in the
shell environment.

[blog post]: https://www.somas.is/note-organizing-nix-configuration-without-flakes.html

I don’t use flakes. If you’re interested in how I structure things
without flakes, check out this [blog post].

Whenever I get a new machine (a really infrequent occurence!), or break
my computer in some silly way (a slighly more common occurence), I
download the latest NixOS live USB image, and I do something like this

    $ git clone https://github.com/somasis/puter
    $ ponysay 'TODO lol'

Updating sources (i.e., the NixOS version used to build system)

    # update *and* commit the changes:
    $ npins-update-commit
    # or just update
    $ npins update

Make sure to ensure things work and build after doing so and before
pushing a lock update, if you can.

## `bin`

Here's a little exposition;
I have a few scripts in here that I think are worth talking about.

### `beets-import-to-library`

Many of the tools I’ve written recently have been in service of making
Beets, the command-line music organizer, nicer to use in a non-terminal
environment.

The idea here is to provide a semi-interactive script for importing
albums into the Beets library, allowing the user to break out into more
manual usage of `beet import <album>...​` when necessary.

[kio-beets]: ./share/kio/servicemenus/beets.desktop

I recently started using KDE Plasma as my main desktop environment after
years of using a `bspwm` based setup,
so I’ve sought to integrate it into some typical use cases.
Consequentially, there’s a KIO service menu for this tool located at
[`./share/kio/servicemenus/beets.desktop`][kio-beets].
It provides a nice menu item, and that's the primary way I interact with it.

Here’s a thousand words:

[The menu item][kio-beets], as shown in Dolphin:
![A popup menu created by a right-click action on a directory named "Phish - Slip Stitch and Pass (1997)"](./img/beets-import-to-library%20(menu%20item).png)

Notification of import starting soon:
![A desktop notification as produced by KDE Plasma](./img/beets-import-to-library%20(importing).png)

Notification of successful import:
![A desktop notification as produced by KDE Plasma](./img/beets-import-to-library%20(imported).png)

#### `beet-hook-diff-{pluginload,cli_exit}`

These two scripts work to provide a hook for Beets
that shows a diff of all the changes that happened to its `library.db`
during its run.

They both require that `sqlite3` be present in the `$PATH`.
The `diff` is calculated using the output of `sqlite3`'s `.dump` command.

To use these hooks properly, both need to be declared in Beets' config:

beets `config.yaml` excerpt:
```yaml
plugins:
  - hook

hook:
  hooks:
    - event: pluginload
      command: beet-hook-diff-pluginload
    - event: cli_exit
      command: beet-hook-diff-cli_exit
```

Pitfalls

The `pluginload` hook merely writes the "before"-state of the database,
and the `cli_exit` one writes the "after"-state.
Notably, this means that the diff is liable to be inaccurate
and show too many changes if you have multiple instances of `beet`
modifying the database at the same time.
Future plans include fixing this
by making the hooks run closer to the database opens and writes,
such as running `pluginload` at `library_opened` instead.
Plus, instead of gathering changes,
the `cli_exit` hook could be ran at `database_change`,
and then the change diffs could be written incrementally,
being more accurate to changes done by the invoking instance of `beet`.
If we keep using `.dump` though,
that would bring along all the impediments that incurs
(slowing down `beet` by dumping already calculated database values,
and potentially causing lots of churn).

### phish-cli

- [`beet-import-phish`](./bin/beet-import-phish)
- [`phish-download-show`](./bin/phish-download-show)
- [`phish-list-shows`](./bin/phish-list-shows)
- [`phish-show-notes`](./bin/phish-show-notes)
- [`phishin-auth-token`](./bin/phishin-auth-token)
- [`phishin-like-show`](./bin/phishin-like-show)
- [`phishin-like-track`](./bin/phishin-like-track)

So here’s the idea.
Let’s say you’re a fan of the jam band [Phish](https://phish.com);
it could happen to you!
In the last year or so after leaving college, I got really into Phish,
and I wanted to write something that would let me listen to shows on
[Phish.in](https://phish.in) without using the website.
I wrote some initial versions that used `mpv` to play them,
mostly fumbling around with trying to get `mpv` to do gapless playback
of the MP3 files being streamed directly from Phish.in.
Eventually, it seemed that I would need to reencode the MP3 files in
order to get it to play gaplessly,
and if I need to download them just to get gapless playback,
then I might as well automate the process
of downloading shows and importing them into in my music library properly,
and simply *play them with my music player* instead of using `mpv`.
Naturally, it turned into a lot of effort because I was having fun with
figuring out the most ergonomic design for the tools.

Or, let’s say you want to download the ten most liked shows that Phish
played during the years 1995 to 2008,
and then import those shows into your Beets library:

    ~ ∴ phish-list-shows -d 1995..2008 -S likes_count -n 10 \
        | xargs beet-import-phish

The most complex script is probably `phish-list-shows`,
mostly because I had to figure out
how to structure its usage for the Phish.in API.
But all the tools are pretty simple and basic
and hopefully are easy to understand.

[example]: https://phish.net/setlists/phish-may-07-1994-the-bomb-factory-dallas-tx-usa.html

`phish-show-notes` is a nice one,
which uses the [Phish.net](http://phish.net) API
to display a show’s setlist notes.
It’s modeled after the layout of Phish.net’s own webpages for notes ([example]).

       Makisupa -> Digital Delay Loop Jam -> Sweet Emotion -> Walk Away ->
       Cannonball -> Purple Rain > HYHU -> Tweeprise

    Encore: Amazing Grace, Sample

    Horn ended with a brief, atypical jam. The jam out of Walk Away included
    a Page solo, teases of It’s Ice and McGrupp, and a Simpsons signal.
    Tweezer was teased in the Sweet Emotion Jam. Amazing Grace was performed
    without microphones. This show was officially released as Live Phish 18.

You can also show the taper notes for the show’s recording provided by Phish.in:

    The Bomb Factory, Dallas, TX

    Set I Source: ? > cassette (unknown gen) > SoundBlaster > WAV > CDwave > SHN
    Tracks 7-9 were on side 2 of the cassette and at much lower level.
    I boosted them to 170% ampl. The results are far from perfect but
    this will have to do until someone finds a DAT copy and transfers.

    Set II Source: DSBD > cass0 > DAT
    Transfer: Sony R300 DAT > Zoltrix Nightingale @ 48 kHz > Samplitude 2496 (resampled to 44.1 kHz) > Sound Forge (normalize) > CD Wave > mkwACT 0.97 w/ seeking.  Performed by Rob Garland (rob@allstarupgrades.com)

    Note: The first set and encore of this show do not circulate to the best of my knowledge.

Behold the untapped power of an unemployed music-listening Linux user.

### `upload`

A script for uploading files to services like 0x0.st (which it defaults to).

It was once packaged in nixpkgs,
but it isn’t anymore, since the URL to it (in my previous dotfiles repository)
became invalid.
Maybe again someday.

## Implementation details

### Secrets (`./secrets`)

I use [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix) for managing secrets.
Ideally, `age-plugin-tpm` is what provides the machine
and user identities to which the secrets are encrypted.

#### Creating and using a secret

```nix
# secrets.nix
{
  "my-new-apikey.age".publicKeys = [ alice bob computer ];
}
```

    $ agenix -e secrets/my-new-apikey.age

```nix
# Somewhere in a NixOS configuration...
{ self, ...}: {
  age.secrets.my-new-apikey.file = "${self}/secrets/my-new-apikey.age";
}
```
