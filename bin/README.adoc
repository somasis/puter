Various scripts I use.

== Exposition

I have a few scripts in here that I think are worth talking about.

upload::
    A script for uploading files to services like 0x0.st (which it defaults to).
    It was once packaged in nixpkgs, but isn't anymore since the URL to it in my
    previous dotfiles repository became invalid. Maybe again someday.

== License

All scripts are in the public domain.
